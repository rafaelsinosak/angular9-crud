# CRUD App - Frontend & Backend 🔄

Welcome to the CRUD App repository, divided between frontend (Angular) and backend (JSON Server). This project provides basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

## Frontend (Angular) 🅰️

The frontend is developed using Angular, a popular framework for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Angular:** A framework for building scalable web applications.
- **Angular Material:** A UI component library for Angular.

### Available Scripts 📜

- `npm start` or `ng serve`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build` or `ng build`: Compile the project for production.
- `npm test` or `ng test`: Run unit tests.
- `npm run e2e` or `ng e2e`: Run end-to-end tests.

### How to Start the Frontend 🚀

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafaelsinosak/angular9-crud.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd angular9-crud/frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view the application.

## Backend (JSON Server) 🚀

The backend uses JSON Server to provide a simple API for CRUD operations.

### Technologies Used 🛠️

- **JSON Server:** A library that simulates a RESTful API from a JSON file.

### Available Scripts 📜

- `npm start`: Start the JSON Server on port 3001.

### How to Start the Backend 🚀

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd angular9-crud/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the JSON Server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now, the frontend and backend are ready to be used together!
